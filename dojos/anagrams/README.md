Another little kata from [codingkatas](http://codekata.com/kata/kata06-anagrams/).

# Problem
This time you have to take a given word list, process it, and give output telling you the number of entries that are anagrams of each other.

For an example of output:

>kinship pinkish
>enlist inlets listen silent
>boaster boaters borates
>fresher refresh
>sinks skins
>knits stink
>rots sort
